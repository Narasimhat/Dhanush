# Using Your Own Images

## How to Add Your Custom Images

1. **Place your images in this `images` folder**

2. **Name your images according to these suggestions:**
   - `students.jpg` - For the "I Was You" slide (students/classroom photo)
   - `village.jpg` - For the 1995 slide (rural village scene)
   - `teacher.jpg` - For Dr. Srinivas slide (teacher/education photo)
   - `family.jpg` - For the cousin sister slide (family photo)
   - `germany.jpg` - For the Germany slide (your work/lab photo)
   - `research.jpg` - For the research/child slide (research/lab photo)
   - `dream.jpg` - For the "Dream Big" slide (inspiring/sky photo)

3. **Supported formats:** JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP

4. **Image recommendations:**
   - **Resolution:** 1920x1080 or higher (for best quality)
   - **File size:** Keep under 2MB per image for faster loading
   - **Aspect ratio:** 16:9 works best for backgrounds

## What Happens

- If you place an image with the correct name, it will automatically be used
- If the image doesn't exist, the presentation will use the online image as a fallback
- You don't need to edit the HTML file - just add your images to this folder!

## Example

If you want to use your own photo for the "I Was You" slide:
1. Save your photo as `students.jpg` in this `images` folder
2. Open the presentation - it will automatically use your image!

## Tips

- **Personal photos work great!** Use photos of:
  - Your village/home
  - Dr. Srinivas or the academy
  - Your family (especially if related to your cousin sister)
  - Your lab/work in Germany
  - Your research/work photos
  
- **Privacy:** Make sure you have permission to use any photos of people

- **Quality:** Use high-quality photos for best results on the big screen
